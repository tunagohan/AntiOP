# AntiOP

## What

What would you do if someone planted a backdoor plugin in your computer?

This plugin will detect and disable the OP itself.

Please make sure to use the permission management plugin.

Administrators do not have to be OPs.

If you take the appropriate steps, you will be protected from attacks.

This is a plugin that supports that. Thank you.

However, there may be times when you really need OP.

You can use Config then.

## How To Use

1. Download Plugin
2. Drag and drop to the plugins directory
3. Run Server

### If you want to add an OP user while the server is running

Edit `plugins > AntiOP > config.yml`

Then `/antiop reload` on the server side console or minecraft chat.

## Permissions

- antiop.use
- antiop.reload
